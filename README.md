# Business Analysis Repository

This repository is a personal project created to showcase my business analysis skills through realistic, fictional business scenarios. I enjoy designing business models and architecting efficient systems around them to explore how they perform in practice.

Everything here—from the business requirements to the data and scenarios—was created by me for fun and professional development.

## What’s Inside

### 📁 [`business_model/`](business_model/) 
Custom-designed database schema and architecture based on a fictional company and its requirements.

### 📁 [`scenario_1_product_sales_returns/`](scenario_1_product_sales_returns/)  
A full business analysis scenario focused on tracking product sales and returns, including:  
- Power BI dashboard  
- Analytical insights based on the underlying database

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how I apply business analysis principles—from requirements gathering and data modeling to reporting and insight generation—in simulated real-world contexts.
