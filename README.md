## Key Responsibilities & Contributions

  - Handmade production processes  
  - Staff hierarchy & roles  
  - Product inventory & movement  
  - Order management & customer interactions  
  - Returns & defect tracking  
- **Data Generation & Automation:** Developed Python scripts to create synthetic data for testing queries, reports, and KPIs.  
- **Business Intelligence & Reporting:** In the future I plan to created PowerBI dashboards monitoring:
  - Return rates by ceramic maker  
  - Inventory turnover  
  - Customer feedback trends
