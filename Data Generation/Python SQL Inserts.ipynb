    "I created this tool to generate realistic inventory records for all 11,512 product instances produced by the studio. Each instance is assigned a status (sold, returned, available, defective) and a location, with statuses weighted by year and artist to reflect realistic business patterns. Older items are mostly sold, while recent items show higher availability and occasional returns. Returned items from older years are more likely to be sold again. To simulate a defect issue, the tool accounts for Ben Carr, a new hire, whose products have a higher chance of being defective or returned. The tool uses employee hire dates to ensure each product instance aligns with its production year, producing a SQL INSERT file."
